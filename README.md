		<li><h2><u>Monitoring and controlling energy usage in buildings and homes</u></h2>
			<p>Monitoring energy consumption in households is an increasingly common and necessary practice in modern society. With this, we can make more efficient use of this vital resource and contribute to the care of the environment and the responsible use of natural resources.</p>
			<p>There are several ways to monitor energy consumption in households. Below, we present some options:</p>
			<ul>
				<img src="https://smartxprokits.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dc-energy-meter.webp" alt="A DC Power Meter">
				<li><b>Power meter:</b> The most common way to monitor energy consumption in households is through an energy meter. This device is installed in the electrical panel of the house and records real-time energy consumption. With an energy meter, we can know how much energy we are consuming at any given time and how consumption is distributed among different appliances and devices.</li>

				<li><b>Mobile applications:</b> Another option is to use mobile applications that allow measuring the energy consumption of devices connected to the electrical network. These applications usually require the installation of a sensor in the electrical outlet and provide information on real-time energy consumption.</li>

				<li><b>Smart plugs:</b> Smart plugs are devices that connect to the electrical outlet and allow controlling the energy consumption of devices connected to them. These plugs are usually compatible with virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, which allows controlling energy consumption remotely.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><h2><u>Optimizing energy usage in industrial processes</u></h2>
			<p>Production is scaled down by many manufacturers due to volatile costs and uncertainty. And the climate crisis makes it even more important to reduce the waste of materials and energy. But what are the most effective ways to improve industrial energy efficiency? And how do you make sure your investments have a positive ROI?</p>
			<p>Emission control is an area that is often overlooked when it comes to saving and recovering energy. Here are a few tips for industrial energy saving, with effective emission control:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b> Make data-driven decisions:</b>Reducing industrial energy costs starts with making data-driven decisions. Data can help you determine where energy can be saved, without it affecting quality, efficiency, and safety. It enables you to validate your solutions in advance, so you can make sure they have a positive ROI.</li>
				<li><b> Recover heat while purifying your exhaust streams:</b>Industrial processes generally produce exhaust streams which often contain unwanted byproducts and pollutants. In many cases, untreated exhaust streams can be harmful to the environment and human health. Industrial scrubbers efficiently remove pollutants from within the exhaust stream. Inside the scrubber, the exhaust stream comes into contact with liquid droplets (e.g., water or another solvent), in which unwanted substances are dissolved. As a result, the exhaust stream is stripped of harmful gasses, particulates, solids, and fumes. After this process, the exhaust stream can be safely released into the environment.<a href="https://joaairsolutions.com/products/energy-recovery-scrubber/" target="_blank">Energy Recovery Scrubbers</a> can combine this process with recovering energy. During the scrubbing process, the scrubbing liquid not only captures pollutants or vapors but also absorbs heat. Hence the Inline Venturi Scrubbers can also function as heat recovery equipment, especially if the exhaust stream has a relatively high temperature. Lowering the temperature of the exhaust stream during the scrubbing process would also enhance the absorption of vapor into the scrubbing liquid. The heat captured by the scrubbing liquid can be recovered using a heat exchanger. That heat can then be reused by other consumers within or outside of the plant, enabling a more economical plant operation.</li>
				<li><b> Measure airflow to discover where energy usage can be optimized:</b>Take control of your processes by measuring airflow. Flow rate (or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid (Product, Air, and/or Gas) that passes per unit of time. If a pipeline is polluted, the flow rate will become lower than usual. Adding one or multiple Air Flow Meters to your production line will enable you to detect pollution at an early stage and solve problems before they become a real threat to productivity or safety. It can also help you reduce your energy usage.</li>
				<li><b>Use energy efficient Deflector Hoods and Deflector Bleeds:</b>Every well-performing extraction system starts with a well-designed <a href="https://joaairsolutions.com/products/deflector-hoods-bleeds/" target="_blank">extraction hood</a>. Hoods can be outfitted with slots to prevent over-extraction and to make the system more energy efficient. Choosing the right scale and shape also ensures balanced extraction.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><h2><u>Enabling remote work and reducing travel-related energy consumption</u></h2>
			<p>A study from peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2304099120" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</a> found that “remote workers could have a 54% lower carbon footprint compared to onsite workers.”</p>

				<p>On top of that, hybrid workers that are working from home between two and four days per week can cut emissions by between 11% and 29%.</p>
				
				<p>However, when it comes to hybrid workers that are only working one day a week at home, the numbers drop all the way down to 2%, further illustrating that more flexible accommodations are better in the long run.</p>
		</li>
		<li><h2><u>Facilitating the use of renewable energy sources</u></h2>
			<p>Renewable energy is the future of power generation, but it still faces many challenges and barriers to widespread adoption. How can we encourage more people and businesses to switch to clean and green sources of energy, such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass? Here are a few ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Policy and regulation:</b>One of the most effective ways to promote renewable energy is to create a supportive policy and regulatory environment that favors its development and deployment. This can include setting ambitious targets and standards for renewable energy share, carbon emissions reduction, and energy efficiency.</li>
				<li><b>Education and awareness:</b>Another important way to promote renewable energy is to raise awareness and educate the public and the stakeholders about its benefits and potential. This can include providing accurate and reliable information, data, and examples of successful renewable energy projects and initiatives. It can also involve engaging and empowering the communities, consumers, and investors to participate in the energy transition and decision-making process. Furthermore, it can foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship that supports the development and dissemination of renewable energy technologies and solutions.</li>
				<li><b>Innovation and research:</b>A third key way to promote renewable energy is to invest in innovation and research that can improve its performance, efficiency, reliability, and integration.

It can also involve enhancing the existing renewable energy technologies, such as improving the storage, transmission, and distribution of electricity from variable sources. Moreover, it can support the creation and adoption of smart grids, microgrids, or hybrid systems that can optimize the use and management of renewable energy resources.</li>
				<li><b>Incentives and rewards:</b>A fourth essential way to promote renewable energy is to offer incentives and rewards that can motivate and attract more users and producers of renewable energy. This can include providing financial and non-financial benefits, such as grants, loans, prizes, or recognition. It can also involve creating and expanding the markets and opportunities for renewable energy products and services, such as green certificates, carbon credits, or green bonds. Additionally, it can encourage and facilitate the collaboration and partnership among the different actors and sectors involved in the renewable energy value chain, such as governments, utilities, businesses, NGOs, or academia.</li>
				<li><b>Behavior and lifestyle:</b>A fifth crucial way to promote renewable energy is to influence and change the behavior and lifestyle of the energy consumers and producers. This can include promoting and adopting energy-saving and energy-efficient practices and habits, such as switching off appliances, using smart meters, or upgrading insulation. It can also involve increasing and diversifying the demand and supply of renewable energy sources, such as installing rooftop solar panels, buying green electricity, or joining a renewable energy cooperative. Furthermore, it can inspire and educate the next generation of energy leaders and innovators, such as teaching and learning about renewable energy in schools, colleges, or online platforms.</li>
				<li><b>Challenges and solutions:</b>A sixth and final way to promote renewable energy is to acknowledge and address the challenges and barriers that hinder its growth and development. This can include identifying and overcoming the technical, economic, social, and political obstacles that limit the access and availability of renewable energy resources and technologies. It can also involve finding and implementing the best practices and solutions that can enhance the quality and sustainability of renewable energy projects and programs. Moreover, it can involve learning and sharing the lessons and experiences from the successes and failures of renewable energy initiatives around the world.</li>
